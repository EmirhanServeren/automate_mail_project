# Automated Mail Project

Developed a simple .py file that executed once in a day for checking is there any friends, family members and etc. have birthday today/tomorrow. If there is/are, sending mail to myself. Using SMTP Protocol library to send mails and connecting MySQl to retrieve birthday data.
